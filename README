Okay - so I guess I need to talk about this thing.

I built this stuff by going through this exercise 

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ClickSecurity/data_hacking/blob/master/dga_detection/DGA_Domain_Detection.ipynb

After running through some machine learning I created datasets that can be applied to a domain and it'll return "legit" or "dga"
